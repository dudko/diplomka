# Scientific tool dealing with elastic properties

  Tool featuring calculation of nano-composite elasticity and visualization of calculated directional dependence of Young's modulus and linear compressibility especially useful for better understanding of materials elasticity.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- latest stable node.js (tested with 6.x and 7.x)
- create-react-app (simplifies configuration)

### Installation

```
npm install # install dependencies
npm run eject # create necessary boiler plate
npm run build # optimized bundle served from express.js

# run the server
